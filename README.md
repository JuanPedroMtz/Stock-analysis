# Stock-analysis

Here are presented the results of the Module 2 of the Bootcamp Data Analysis and Visualization regarding using VBA on Excel

## Overview of the project

Steve wants to help his parents to make the better choice for the investment of their money. Steve's parents are crazy about green energy, so they want to invest all their money in DAQO New Energy Corporation. Steve, as a good investor, wants to check all the possible stocks in order to realize if investing in DAQO is a good choice, and to make a more diversified portfolio for his parents. We are going to help Steve analyze stock data of 2017 and 2018, so he can give his parents the best choice to invest. We are going to be working with stcock data that Steve gave us, and we are going to return a document where Steve can visualize the best stock options. 

## Results

After running the analysis of both years, we can see many differences in them: 

- 2017 was a pretty nice year for stock options. Just one of the stock options returned negative results.

- 2018 was a pretty bad year for stock options. Just two options returned poitive results.

Here are the formulas how we obtained the results of both years.

Also we have a comparison of the execution time between the original script and the refractored one. Original Script was much faster than the refractored:

## Summary

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- Advantages: I think the main advantage of refractoring a code is that you make that code more understandable for you. You know what to change in order that you could understand it better without cracking it. 
- Disadvantage: The main disadvantage is that we can code it in a incorrect way, and can cause some errors. Or like in this case, the code could take longer to run. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
I think I understand my code more easier than the original script, but as we could see, my code takes longer to run than the original code.
